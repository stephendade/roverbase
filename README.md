A PCB design for Power and Motor control for small robots

This is a PCB design for a robot. It uses 4x 18650 batteries to provide a regulated power supply for electronics, power monitoring and 2x brushed motor controllers.

Todo:
Flip JST-GH power connector
5V power reg - put components closer together
Ext switch option for power switches (W/ESD protection?)
Put power power and power connectors further from battery case
Remove fuse. Look at current limiting FET?
Better alignment of labels
